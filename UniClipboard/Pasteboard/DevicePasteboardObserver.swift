/// Reads `UIPasteboard.general` and exposes the result as an observable

/// Re-reads on:
/// - init (for the cold-launch initial value)
/// - `UIPasteboard.changedNotification`
/// - `UIApplication.didBecomeActiveNotification` (foreground)
/// - explicit `read()` calls from the UI (refresh button / pull-to-refresh)
///
/// Reads text and images. Image read priority is PNG > HEIC > JPEG > GIF
/// (PNG is the screenshot default; HEIC over JPEG matches modern Photos).
/// Bytes are pulled via `data(forPasteboardType:)` — never `pb.image`,
/// which decodes through `UIImage` and breaks the §4.2 hash by changing
/// bytes. File and Group reads from UIPasteboard are not meaningful on
/// iOS (Files-app + Share Extension is the right surface for those).
///
/// DEBUG env hooks (only present so design can be inspected without
/// interactive simulator; not feature flags):
/// - `UC_DEVICE_IMAGE=<fixtureName>` → bypass UIPasteboard, return the
///   named built-in image fixture. Optional `UC_DEVICE_IMAGE_EXT=<ext>`
///   overrides the file extension (default `png`). Image hook takes
///   priority over `UC_DEVICE_TEXT` when both are set.
/// - `UC_DEVICE_TEXT`:
///   - unset           → real `UIPasteboard.general` reads
///   - empty string    → reports `nil` (drives empty-state UI)
///   - any other value → reports `Clipboard.fromText(value)`
///
/// Reads on iOS 16+ paint the system "pasted from <App>" banner.
/// Acceptable for now; switching to `UIPasteControl` to suppress is its
/// own UI cycle.
