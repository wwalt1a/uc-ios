/// **Free, no-prompt detection** (`pollDetectionIfChanged`, `detection`):
/// reads only `changeCount` + `hasStrings`/`hasImages`/`hasURLs`, none of
/// which paint the privacy banner or fire the modal. Runs on
/// `changedNotification`, `didBecomeActiveNotification`, and once per engine
/// tick when auto-push is OFF (the default). Surfaces the Home one-tap
/// `PasteButton` hint without ever touching content.
///
/// **Content reads** (`read`, `pollIfChanged`, `snapshot`): touch the actual
/// bytes and so CAN prompt. Driven only by (a) the engine tick when the user
/// opted into auto-push, or (b) an explicit push action. The Home
/// `PasteButton` is the prompt-free alternative: it hands us already-read
/// bytes via `consentPush` → `adoptConsentPush`, so the default push path
/// reads nothing here at all.
///
/// Reads text and images. Image read priority is PNG > HEIC > JPEG > GIF
/// (PNG is the screenshot default; HEIC over JPEG matches modern Photos).
/// Bytes are pulled via `data(forPasteboardType:)` — never `pb.image`,
/// which decodes through `UIImage` and breaks the §4.2 hash by changing
/// bytes. File and Group reads from UIPasteboard are not meaningful on
/// iOS (Files-app + Share Extension is the right surface for those).
///
/// DEBUG env hooks (only present so design can be inspected without
/// interactive simulator; not feature flags):
/// - `UC_DEVICE_IMAGE=<fixtureName>` → bypass UIPasteboard, return the
///   named built-in image fixture. Optional `UC_DEVICE_IMAGE_EXT=<ext>`
///   overrides the file extension (default `png`). Image hook takes
///   priority over `UC_DEVICE_TEXT` when both are set.
/// - `UC_DEVICE_TEXT`:
///   - unset           → real `UIPasteboard.general` reads
///   - empty string    → reports `nil` (drives empty-state UI)
///   - any other value → reports `Clipboard.fromText(value)`
///
/// Content reads on iOS 16+ paint the system "pasted from <App>" banner
/// (and the modal for cross-app content). The default push path avoids
/// both by going through SwiftUI's `PasteButton` (see `PastedItemExtractor`
/// + `SyncEngine.consentPush`); the content reads that remain here only run
/// when the user opts into fully-automatic push.
