/// Reads the current WiFi SSID via `NEHotspotNetwork.fetchCurrent` and
/// surfaces the Core Location authorization state required for it.
///
/// Gotchas worth knowing before touching this file:
///
/// - The supported read path is `NEHotspotNetwork.fetchCurrent`, not the
///   older `CNCopyCurrentNetworkInfo`. On iOS 26 the CaptiveNetwork
///   entry point (`CNCopySupportedInterfaces`) returns nil even when
///   the entitlement + Location auth are both present, which silently
///   maps to "未连接 WiFi" in the UI. `NEHotspotNetwork` keeps working.
/// - The call returns a useful SSID only when (a) the app holds the
///   `Access WiFi Information` entitlement
///   (`com.apple.developer.networking.wifi-info`), and (b) Location When
///   In Use authorization has been granted. Either missing → nil.
/// - Simulator: there's no Wi-Fi interface to query. We detect the
///   simulator via `targetEnvironment(simulator)` and surface
///   `.unavailable` so the UI hides the auth/SSID row. The
///   `UC_MOCK_CURRENT_SSID` env hook lets screenshot recipes pretend a
///   network is connected.
/// - Auth status: we use the instance-bound `authorizationStatus` (iOS 14+)
///   rather than the deprecated class-level accessor. The delegate's
///   `locationManagerDidChangeAuthorization(_:)` is the canonical entry
///   point — it fires once on first init and again whenever the user
///   changes the setting in system Settings.
///
/// This type is intentionally @MainActor + ObservableObject so SwiftUI views
/// can bind directly to `authState` / `currentSSID`. A single instance
/// lives on `AppViewModel`.
