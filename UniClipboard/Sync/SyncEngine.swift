/// Drives the auto-sync state machine. Cycle 9 product surface — replaces

/// converges both sides automatically.
///
/// State machine per `tick()`:
///
/// 1. `GET /SyncClipboard.json` (§2.1) for server metadata.
/// 2. If `server.hash != lastSyncedContentHash`, the server has new content:
///    - If we already fetched bytes for this hash and are waiting for the
///      user to flip the auto-apply toggle (`stagedServerHash == server.hash`),
///      no-op. Otherwise download, verify, and stage `vm.serverLatest`.
///    - If `appSettings.autoApplyServerChanges` is on, write to
///      `UIPasteboard.general` via `pasteboard.write`, advance
///      `lastSyncedContentHash` to the server hash, drop the staged hash.
///    - If off, set `state = .hasNewUnwritten`, keep the staged hash so
///      subsequent ticks don't re-download.
/// 3. Otherwise (server unchanged), check `vm.deviceClipboard.hash` against
///    `lastSyncedContentHash`. The observer is the source of truth — it
///    auto-reads on `UIPasteboard.changedNotification` and
///    `didBecomeActiveNotification`, so by the time the engine ticks, the
///    cached `current` reflects whatever the user just copied. If hashes
///    differ, the engine pushes via `vm.push()` (which itself does a
///    fresh `pasteboard.snapshot()` for bytes).
/// 4. On success, advance `lastSyncedContentHash` to the new content hash.
///
/// Conflict resolution is server-wins. When both sides changed inside the
/// same tick the server is processed first; on the next tick the device
/// pasteboard now matches the server (we just wrote it) and the hash dedup
/// short-circuits push, so we don't echo the server's content back to it.
///
/// Errors:
/// - `.authFailed` (401) → `state = .authFailed`, the loop pauses entirely.
///   Resume by calling `start()` again after the user fixes credentials.
/// - `.networkUnreachable` / `.timeout` / others → `state = .offlineRetrying`
///   and the next tick fires after `offlineBackoffSeconds` instead of the
///   normal cadence.
/// - `.notFound` (404) on server GET is the documented "empty server"
///   state and is treated as success — fall through to the push side.
